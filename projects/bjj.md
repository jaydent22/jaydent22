It may not a coding project, I have been working on a long-time "project" of practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ). After doing taekwondo for three years, I decided to switch to BJJ after a visit to the island of Hawaii, where I watched my cousin, a BJJ practitioner, in action at a class taught by BJJ black belt and former mixed martial artist B.J. Penn.

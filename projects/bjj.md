It may not a coding project, I have been working on a long-time "project" of practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ). After doing taekwondo for three years, I decided to switch to BJJ in 2012 after a visit to the island of Hawaii, where I watched my cousin, a BJJ practitioner, in action at a class taught by BJJ black belt and former mixed martial artist B.J. Penn. Since then, I have been doing it as a hobby and physical activity, even participating in competitions. Giving me the confidence and ability to defend myself, as well as the discipline to not hurt others outside of self-discipline, I feel like BJJ is an important part of my life that contributed to who I am today.

As of September 2022, I am a blue belt (the belt system for adults is white, blue, purple, brown and black), but I hope to reach the rank of black belt and potentially teach others what I have learned through my years of training.p

Developers encounter problems of some sort on a daily basis, especially with programming. Something fails to compile, a program does not run as it is intended, an error somewhere crashes a program. The recurrence of these issues eventually leads to developers facing the same types of issues, and dealing with each specific instance of the issue can become quite tedious. Rather than having to devise a new solution for the same issue, it would be much more optimal (and much less time-consuming) to use an existing general solution that you can change to fit your current problem. This is where design patterns come in. As architect Christoper Alexander described, a design pattern "describes a problem that occurs over and over in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice." This is a wordy description, so let's use an example.

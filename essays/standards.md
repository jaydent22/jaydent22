Picture this: you are a software engineer working on a team project. One team member, no matter how hard they try, cannot get their code to work, so they ask you for help. They show you their code, and you are presented with a screen full of lines like this:

Of course, someone without programming knowledge would have trouble understanding it; however, even programmers would have a hard time understanding such messy code. Many programmers overlook the importance of coding standards and clean code, adopting an "if it works, it works" mentality. The program is functioning as expected and there are no bugs, so why waste time making it look nicer? Consider teammates and future employees who have to read this code: are they able to understand how it works in the way it is written? If any changes are required to this code, would they be able to implement such changes? Would they be able to provide any sort of help without understanding the code? This is where coding standards and clean code come in. Emphasizing readability as much as functionality benefits not only the programmer, but also those who have to work with what the programmer creates.

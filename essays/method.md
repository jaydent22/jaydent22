Picture this: you are a software engineer working on a team project. One team member, no matter how hard they try, cannot get their code to work, so they ask you for help. They show you their code, and you are presented with a screen full of lines like this:

Naturally, someone without programming knowledge would have trouble understanding it; however, even programmers would struggle with understanding such messy code. Many programmers overlook the importance of coding standards and clean code, adopting an "if it works, it works" mentality. The program is functioning as expected and there are no bugs, so why waste time making it look nicer? Consider teammates and future employees who have to read this code: are they able to understand how it works in the way it is written? If any changes are required to this code, would they be able to implement such changes? Would they be able to provide any sort of help without understanding the code? This is where coding standards and clean code come in. Emphasizing readability as much as functionality by conforming to coding standards benefits not only the programmer, but also those who have to work with what the programmer creates.

## The Importance of Coding Standards

Programming, especially in languages like Java and C/C++, is already difficult to read, as programming syntax is very different from spoken and written language. As such, programmers often struggle with deciphering programs, which is only exacerbated by poor and messy programming. Even programmers who create messy code may have trouble reading their own programs, making any needed changes much harder to implement and decreasing efficiency. Of course, in athletic programming and competitions, speed is valued over form, so programmers write programs quickly without paying much attention to the "look" of their program; however, this sort of approach in the software industry itself leads to the problems mentioned above. 

The desire to increase readability and efficiency led to the implementation of coding standards. By conforming their code to coding standards, programmers can write code that functions properly and looks clean, satisfying both customers and developers. When modifications to source code are required, the readability of standardized code makes the modification process much faster, thereby more efficient (it could be argued that fixing code to conform to standards slows modification down, but the gains in time from standardized code far outweigh the slight losses).

Coding standards can even help in the process of learning new programming languages.

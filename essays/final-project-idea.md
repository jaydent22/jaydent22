## Overview

The problem: Parking is hard to find. Parking stalls are not guaranteed, people with parking passes do not have a fair chance to get a stall, and open parking spaces could potentially be inconvenient for the driver.

The solution: That's My Spot is an app that allows users to reserve a parking stall in the parking structure. To meet users' preferences, the app will allow users to prioritize a level or side from which the app will reserve a stall.

## Mockup Page Ideas

Potential pages:
<ul>
<li>Landing page</li>
<li>Sign-in page</li>
<li>Admin page</li>
<li>Availability page (accessible by admin only)</li>
<li>Parking pass holder page</li>
<li>Guest page</li>
<li>Payment page (accessible by guest only)</li>
</ul>

## Use Case Ideas

<ul>
<li>Parking pass holders login, select preference and generate parking stall #</li>
<li>Admins (commuter services) may override reserved stalls, view open and taken stalls.</li>
<li>Guests (non parking pass holders) may generate a random stall throughout the structure and must pay afterward</li>
</ul>

## Beyond the Basics

<ul>
<li>Parking pass holders have priority over non parking pass holders</li>
<li>Viewing amount of stalls left</li>
<li>Side and level can be chosen by parking pass holders given that there are enough stalls</li>
</ul>
